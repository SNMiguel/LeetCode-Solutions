# LeetCode-Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository!  
Here, I share my journey through solving LeetCode problems in Python, along with clean, readable, and well-documented code. My goal is to stay consistent, improve problem-solving skills, and hopefully help others in the process.


## 📌 What's Inside

- ✅ Solutions organized by problem number and name
- 🧠 Focus on clarity, efficiency, and clean coding practices
- 💬 Some solutions include brief explanations and comments
- 🧪 Occasionally includes multiple approaches (brute-force, optimized, etc.)


## 🛠 Languages & Tools

- **Language:** Python 3
- **IDE:** VS Code / Jupyter
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub


## 💡 Why This Repo?

I created this repo to:

- Build a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Track my daily progress and stay accountable
- Help others find reference solutions when they're stuck


## 🚧 In Progress

I'm still working through problems one step at a time.  
Stay tuned for updates as I aim to solve:

- [ ] 100+ problems milestone
- [ ] Problems by category (Arrays, HashMaps, Trees, etc.)
- [ ] Add explanations to tricky problems
